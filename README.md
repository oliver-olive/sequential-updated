2022-9-21 update:
1. if/else block won't merge again
2. Problem appears when drag a task box then try to add an if/else block,
   the task block will float on the canvas. You have to drag it to any available placeholders.
   But this makes sense to me, because user has to choose which branch that task belongs to.
